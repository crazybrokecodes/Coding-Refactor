I simplified the CSS for better usability and visual for the user.

The project was re-ordered in a manner where it was still visible and pleasing as an outcome for the user who was viewing the page. 

The main problem I solved was the accesibility and structure of the html and css. The html lacked semantic tags, using div tags instead. The alt description was conflicting with both the images and other descriptions, so I kept the alt '' empty.  

I learned that there are many ways to work around with the codes and achieve the exact output on the webpage. It may not be the greatest, but for the average viewer/user, they will most likely not notice the changes/updates of your CSS. A web developer on the plus side would have an easier time viewing these codes to make proper changes if it needs any structural updates or any form of simplication.
